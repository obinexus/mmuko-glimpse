I am **Nnamdi Michael Okpala**, a **24-year-old disabled care leaver** (autism/ADHD) who entered care at **age 9** and was **discharged without support** at **24**.

Today, I **lawfully override** Thurrock Council under:
- **Section 203, Housing and Planning Act 2016**
- **Human Rights Act 1998 (Articles 3, 8, 14)**
- **Equality Act 2010**

**You have 14 days** to:
1. **Provide deconstructive proof** that I was **not homeless**, **not denied care**, and **not discriminated against**;
2. **Or pay Â£240 million** as **lawful recompense** for **8 human rights violations**.

**This is not a request. This is a legal override.**

**Evidence attached.**  
**This email is timestamped and legally archived.**

If you fail to respond, I will:
- **File judicial review**
- **Submit to UN Special Rapporteur**
- **Publish this scandal nationally**

Regards,  
**Nnamdi Michael Okpala**
